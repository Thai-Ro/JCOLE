        <p>Born in Frankfurt, Germany and raised in 
        Fayetteville, North Carolina, Jermaine Cole
        got into hip-hop through his stepfather's copy
        of 2Pacalypse Now, which led to a deep 
        fascination with 2Pac and immersion in the work 
        of Nas, the Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, and Canibus, 
        among many other artists. Cole's high school grades 
        earned him an academic scholarship to attend St. 
        John's University in New York City, where the 
        fledgling MC and beatmaker knew he could make 
        progress as a musician. After numerous days spent outside Jay-Z's office in 
        hopes of giving him a demo, Cole finally ran into 
        his idol, but the reception was well below chilly.
        He was shocked weeks later by a call from the man, and 
        was even more surprised to be asked to contribute to The 
        Blueprint 3, heard on the appropriately titled "A Star Is 
        Born."With only one mixtape in his discography, namely The 
        Come Up -- boasting his own production credits beside 
        those of major figures such as Salaam Remi, Large 
        Professor, Just Blaze, and Kanye West -- Cole signed 
        with Roc Nation. By the end of 2010, he issued two tapes 
        for the label, The Warm Up and Friday Night Lights.In 
        2011, Roc Nation released Cole's official debut, Cole 
        World: The Sideline Story, which debuted on top of the 
        Billboard 200.</p>
        <p> Its biggest single, "Work Out," became 
        Cole's first Top 40 pop hit as a headliner, reaching 
        number 13 and eventually going double platinum. 
        The follow-up, Born Sinner, followed in 2013 and 
        spawned singles such as the Miguel collaboration 
        "Power Trip" (a number 19 hit) and the TLC-assisted 
        "Crooked Smile" (number 27). "Power Trip" also earned 
        Cole his first recognition from Grammy voters, 
        who nominated the track for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. 
        Titled after the address of his childhood home, 2014 
        Forest Hills Drive continued his streak of number one 
        LPs in 2014. </p>
